From the tropical shores of New Caledonia, through the spirited heart of Sydney, to the timeless charm of Paris, my journey has woven through the realms of English literature, Fashion design, and the intricacies of programming.<br>
Alongside my studies at Ã‰cole 42 Paris, I'm refining my skills in traditional lacemaking with one of France's best artisans.<br>
On my quest to blend technology, traditional craft, poetry, and fashion, I am weaving my way through C/C++, computer vision, mixed reality, and generative AI.
